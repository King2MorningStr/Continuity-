      # Briefcase might prompt for Android SDK license acceptance.
      # Using --no-input to avoid hanging.
      # Note: Briefcase typically handles Android SDK setup automatically.
      # If explicit license acceptance is needed, it might require a more complex setup,
      # but --no-input is the standard way to fail fast if interaction is required.
